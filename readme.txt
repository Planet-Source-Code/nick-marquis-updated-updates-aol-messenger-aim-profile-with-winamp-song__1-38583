'SINfo v1 (Beta 2)
'Coded using Vb6
'Tested on Winamp 2.81 and AIM 4.8

'Yea so this is SINfo... It takes the song winamp is playing and attempts to
'update your AIM profile with your current song in it.

'To use it, you need to place '%s' in your profile where you want the song
'and prefix (Now Playing:, etc...) to appear.
'You must run this while Winamp and AIM are running and playing/logged in.

'*NOTE: Don't Edit the %s or the 'Song' text in your profile
'while SINfo is running. This will cause SINfo to stop updating your profile
'and possibly cause an error.

'Fool around with it. Have fun!

'BTW.. I found a new way to update the AIM profile. This new way, to my know-
'lege does not crash AIM. Lets hope it says that way.

'Peace!
